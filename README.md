# Trout Smack
## A simple bot for smacking others with a wet trout or minnow
This bot allows you to smack another user with a Trout or a Minnow. It is accessed using the "Apps" menu that appears when you click a user in Discord.<br>
## Usage
Right click a user, and under "Apps" select what you want to use on them.
|Command|Effect|
|:--|:--|
|Trout Smack|Smacks a user with a wet trout|
|Minnow Smack|Smacks a user with a tiny minnow|
|Trout Stats|Shows how much a user has been smacked|

Using `/smackboard` in chat will show who is getting smacked the most.
## Effects
* When smacking someone there is a 5% chance it will be a special fish instead, which is more powerful than a regular fish.
* If a user accumulates 100 trout smacks, something larger comes to them instead.
* Every 10 minnow smacks becomes one trout smack.
* If multiple people smack someone at the same time, they will get combo smacked, which is saved to their profile.
